    "title": "Remote Work and Networking: The Virtual Coffee Break",
    "body": "2020/08/22 - Remote work is the new normal, and it’s here for the foreseeable future. There are some definite perks to working from home–like not having to actually change out of your pajamas–but there are some difficulties as well. Networking is one of those. How do you network virtually? Enter the virtual coffee break. A virtual coffee break is a substitute for the type of socialization you would normally enact if not for stay-at-home orders and social distancing. You invite one or a few people to have coffee, but in this case, you all meet virtually rather than at a coffee shop. Video chat app, such as Daylo Meet, can enhance the experience. Of course, virtual coffee breaks aren’t quite the same as in-person communication, but it’s better than letting important networking connections slip past you this year. Networking is critical to bolstering your career, leading to new job opportunities, investment opportunities, and collaborations. You can’t afford to isolate your career while you isolate from COVID-19. Do a practice virtual coffee break with friends first. This will give you the chance to try out the Daylo video chat tools. Some things to consider are conversation topics, a time limit, and how to handle awkward pauses. All of these are slightly different in a virtual coffee break as compared to in-person meet ups. Another thing to consider is group size. Just like a normal coffee break in a small coffee shop, there are limitations to how many people you should invite. In person, this is limited by table size and physical space in a small shop. Virtually, group size should be limited as well. Groups larger than four can become complicated by technical issues, such as feedback and reverb, and by ease of conversation. People get left out when groups are large and meetings are virtual. Sticking to a small invite list is best for effective virtual coffee breaks. If you want to network with a lot of people, it’s better to set up numerous small breaks than one large break with everyone. Once you’ve practiced and worked out the kinks of hosting a virtual coffee break, decide who you’d like to network with and schedule a meet up. Make sure you include a Daylo Meet meeting link. This is equivalent to sending directions and an address for an in-person coffee meet up. One advantage to virtual coffee breaks is the ability to invite people located anywhere in the world. That is obviously not possible when it comes to in-person coffee meet ups. You should be aware of differences in time zone and specify which time zone you are setting your meeting to. As the virtual coffee break host, it’s good to identify an agenda, topic, or theme for the break time. Make sure you start with introductions so everyone knows each other’s name. However, don’t fret if the conversation gets off topic, because the real goal here is just making connections and getting to know each other better. Some ideas for topics include the following:  What conferences are you attending this year? What is the biggest challenge facing your industry? Would you like to introduce us to your pets? What’s working well for you with remote work? What’s your favorite coffee drink? What project are you currently working on? What’s your favorite social media platform?The point is to break the ice with new people and truly get to know them. This might lead to follow up conversations or connections on social media, but it may not. It takes a little courage to invite people you don’t know well to join you in a virtual coffee break, but most people are feeling eager for a social opportunity these days. Be brave and make that first move.   "

    "title": "Should You Let Your Employees Work From Home",
    "body": "2019/10/26 - Most managers will have thought about letting their employees work from home at some point. However, it is never a straightforward decision, as what you gain in one area, you lose in another. While previously, there was a shift towards increasing worker flexibility, the tide seems to have turned back. Now, more companies are bringing their workforce back into the office to try and boost their output. It is never an easy decision to make, and you need to ask yourself several questions before making a decision. What Does Your Company Do?: You should first ask yourself what your company does and how it would align with a remote workforce. If you require a lot of collaboration and team discussions, it may be easier to bring everybody together in the office. On the other hand, if their job requires long periods of focus, working from home could remove a lot of distractions. Do You Want Creativity or Productivity?: As a general rule, people are more creative in groups and more productive on their own. If you are continually looking for new ideas and out-the-box thinking, you are going to have more luck having your workforce under the same roof.  It may be that part of your workforce suits remote working more than others. Programmers are a perfect example of a position which almost always works better remotely.   Could You Reduce Overheads?: If there are fewer people in the office, it may be possible to downsize your building and reduce your expenses. Everyone who comes into work costs you money through the desk space and electricity that they use. Add on perks such as free coffee and biscuits, and you will save a lot of cash if you allow a large section of your staff to work from home. Do You Have a Global Reach?: If you are a global company, you can make tremendous strides in other countries by employing somebody who lives there. Naturally, they will have to work remotely, and there can be problems with the time-difference. However, if you are looking to break into a market, it may be a sacrifice worth making. How Important is Your Workplace Culture?: Productivity and workplace culture are closely linked. It can be hard for collaborations and working relationships to develop when people do not meet face to face. Again, it depends on the nature of your work, as to how important this is. However, if you want to instill a particular company ethos on your employees, you are better served to do this in the office. There is no right or wrong answer when deciding if you should let your employees work from home. It depends on your companies goals and how picky you can be when choosing your workforce. Consider as many aspects of your business as you can, and decide if the benefits from allowing your employee’s flexibility outweigh the gains of coming into the office. "

    "title": "Keep Yourself on Track (and Sane) When Working From Home",
    "body": "2019/01/11 - You have this project to finish, but the garage needs to be cleaned. Better take the Christmas lights down, oh, and make sure you save some time for checking out and replying to LinkedIn and Twitter posts. If this sounds familiar to you, it’s probably because you’re trying to keep yourself on track when working from home.   According to the most recent data from Gallup, about 43 percent of Americans work remotely at least part time, and Census data has found that about 3 percent of employees work from home at least half the time. And while people have lots of reasons for being drawn to work-from-home jobs, they often have similar complaints and hurdles. But with just a few tips you can ensure you’re staying sane while working from home. Stay on Schedule: You may not want or be able to work 9-5, but you should maintain a regular schedule. If every day is spent simply flying by the seat of your pants, you never give your brain a chance to cool down. This can only add to your stress level. Take Breaks: Establishing and keeping to a schedule doesn’t mean you keep your nose constantly to the grindstone. Arguably, the best part of working from home is having the freedom to take a long lunch or walk the dog an extra half-mile.   Talk to a Human at Least Once a Day: Particularly for those folks who work from home and live alone, remote work can be incredibly isolating. Whether it’s a chat with a grocery store clerk or a phone call with an old friend, maintaining human contact is crucial, since you can’t just lean over to the next cubicle and get your social fix. Set up an Office Space: One of the most common complaints about working from home is the lack of separation from the job and the home. If you can, set up your workspace in a spare room or at least somewhere in your house you don’t have to constantly look at. It also might help you claim a small tax break, but you’ll need to talk to your tax preparer about that. Push Through Low Productivity Times: We all go through periods where we don’t feel like we’re accomplishing anything. This happens for folks who work in an office every day, too, but they benefit from being able to hide in plain sight. When you’re the only person in your office, there’s nowhere to hide. When you’re feeling unproductive, just keep going and don’t allow yourself to call it a day early. Train Your Friends and Family: Especially if you’re new to remote work, your friends and family might look at this as a chance to spend more time with you when you really should be working. As we said before, long lunches are great from time to time, but you certainly still need to make money. So try to set up boundaries with the people in your life that make it clear you still value your work. Don’t Buy Certain Foods: Keeping lots of snacks and junk food on-hand can be a recipe for weight gain when you spend almost all your time at home. Be honest with yourself about your eating (and snacking) habits. If you just can’t resist polishing off a sleeve of Oreos, don’t buy them. And make sure you’re eating actual meals, too, so you’ll be less inclined to graze as you walk past the kitchen. Get Dressed: One of the most-ballyhooed benefits of working from home is that you probably could do it in your PJs. And while it’s tempting, you should get ready in the morning (or whenever you start your day) pretty much as you would if you had a commute. Sure, you can swap the suit for track pants or the shoes for slippers, but getting ready every morning helps switch your brain into work mode rather than chill mode. Leave the House: Fresh air and sunshine are well-known to have major benefits to your mental and physical health. Even taking a walk around the block is believed to lower blood pressure in many people. So when you hit a stopping point, or even before you begin your day (depending on your location and the season), walk away from the computer and step outside. If you can fit a workout into your out-of-doors adventure, even better. Open a Window: The isolation common for many folks who work from home often is just a matter of perspective. If you only see what’s going on inside your office/house, that’s what your perspective will be. Shifting that perspective could be as simple as pulling open your curtains to see the view or all the activity happening in your neighborhood.   Clean up Every Day: This is harder for those who create a lot of mess in their work, but keeping your workspace tidy helps keep your mental space free of clutter as well. It also will help tomorrow you be more productive because you won’t have to clean up after yesterday you. Throw away any scrap pieces of paper, return any plates or cups you got from the kitchen and return any books or tools you may have gotten down during the course of the day. If you talk to someone who works from home, they’ll likely tell you they’d rather do nothing else. There’s no doubt the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but only once you’ve learned to put the negatives aside. A few simple tips can help you combat the isolation that comes with remote work and keep you productive (and sane) when you’re working from home. "

However over time it became clear that the DFM notification popup window was probably not a good idea. So we had to do something about it and here is what we came up with: In the latest Daylo Meet version when your party goes DFM, instead of you seeing this annoying popup dialog: You now see this unobtrusive toast notification at the top of your screen: The toast will stay up for 10 seconds and disappear automatically. During the 10 seconds, you too can go DFM by pressing the JOIN button. And if you miss the toast you can always switch to Distraction Free Mode from the utility toolbar that appears on the right side of your screen.  "
